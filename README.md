# Example Office Add-In Using Laravel Passport

This is a modified version of the Yo Office CLI generated Add-In template. [Original Repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-TaskPane-JS)

The purpose of this repo is to serve as an example OAuth integration with Laravel for an Outlook Add-In.

## Installation

Copy .env-example to .env and populate with:

- Application's Passport implicit authorization route (see below for example)
- Application's API endpoint

Run: 

```shell script
yarn install
yarn dev-serve
```

Import the Add-In into your Outlook application or Outlook web (**see note below** [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing))

NOTE: At the time of creating this, "Sideload automatically" is not functional with Outlook so this can be ignored in the above URL. Manual load still has hot-reloading while using dev-serve when testing in Outlook for Web or a local installation of Office.

Select an email to reveal your add-in and click "Show Taskpane" to test your OAuth flow.

## Laravel Config

Follow the normal configuration steps for Laravel Passport.

Create a new client and set its redirect URL to https://localhost:3000/oauth.html

Add your implicit OAuth route that is specified in your Add-In .env.

Basic example: 

```php

//web.php
Route::get('/implicit', function(Request $request) {

    $request->session()->put('state', $state = Str::random(40));

    //update client_id to match your new client
    $query = http_build_query([
        'client_id' => '3',
        'redirect_uri' => "https://localhost:3000/oauth.html",
        'response_type' => 'token',
        'scope' => '',
        'state' => $state,
    ]);

    return redirect('/oauth/authorize?'.$query);

})->middleware(['auth']);
```
